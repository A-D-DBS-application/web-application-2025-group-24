GroundLink (Group 24)

Description

GroundLink is a discreet online platform that connects landowners and real estate developers outside the public market.
The platform enables landowners to offer building land anonymously while allowing only verified developers to view listings and respond.
By avoiding public listing websites, GroundLink reduces price inflation competition and unwanted visibility, creating a fair and efficient off market transaction channel.

Vision

To enable fair and discreet land transactions by bringing landowners and developers together in a trusted closed environment.
GroundLink aims to reduce market friction remove unnecessary intermediaries and unlock hidden land supply.

Core Problem

Real estate developers want to acquire building land before it appears on public platforms because public listings often lead to inflated prices and excessive competition.
At the same time many landowners want to sell quietly without public exposure involvement of real estate agents or social pressure from family and neighbours.
These landowners often lack a clear price reference and are therefore open to a silent sale.

Solution

GroundLink provides a closed online platform where
Landowners can anonymously list their land off market
Only verified real estate developers can log in view listings and contact sellers

This creates a discreet and efficient channel between buyers and sellers without public visibility intermediaries or unnecessary complexity.

MVP Scope

The MVP is designed to validate one key question
Are landowners willing to offer their land through a discreet online platform outside the public market

To answer this the MVP focuses on two core features
Landowners can create a land listing with location size price and optional anonymity
Developers can log in browse available listings and respond

Why this MVP is Valuable

The MVP is low complexity but high validation value
It allows fast testing of interest on both sides of the market
It forms a scalable foundation for future features such as
Automated valuation
AI based matching
Notary integrations
Premium developer access
